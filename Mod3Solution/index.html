				I feel so unsure
				As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
				As the music dies, something in your eyes
				Calls to mind a silver screen
				And all its sad good-byes
				I'm never gonna dance again
				Guilty feet have got no rhythm
				Though it's easy to pretend
				I know you're not a fool
				Should've known better than to cheat a friend
				And waste the chance that I'd been given
				So I'm never gonna dance again
				The way I danced with you
				Time can never mend
				The careless whispers of a good friend
				To the heart and mind
				Ignorance is kind
				There's no comfort in the truth
				Pain is all you'll find
				I'm never gonna dance again
				Guilty feet have got no rhythm
				Though it's easy to pretend
				I know you're not a fool
				I should've known better than to cheat a friend
				And waste the chance that I'd been given
				So I'm never gonna dance again
				The way I danced with you, ohh
