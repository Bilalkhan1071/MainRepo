			You wouldn't get this from any other guy, I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling, Gotta make you understand, Never gonna give you up,
			Never gonna let you down, Never gonna run around and desert you, Never gonna make you cry, Never gonna say goodbye, Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

			We've known each other for so long, Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
		Inside we both know what's been going on, We know the game and we're gonna play it, And if you ask me how I'm feeling, Don't tell me you're too blind to see
		Never gonna give you up, Never gonna let you down, Never gonna run around and desert you, Never gonna make you cry, Never gonna say goodbye
		Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you, Never gonna give you up, Never gonna let you down, Never gonna run around and desert you, Never gonna make you cry
		Never gonna say goodbye, Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Want Free Money?</a></p>
